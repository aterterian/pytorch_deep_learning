# Deep Learning With Pytorch

Create deep learning models using Pytorch library. PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, 
used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab.

This repository contains different kinds of models from RNN to CNN and Autoencoders, and I'm adding more regularly.

### [To-Do]
1. Fix GPU usage code ( if you can fix the problem please submit a pull request.)

#### Disclaimer
Not all of the codes in this repository are mine, I've used internet extensibly to add code from here and there, unfortunetly I can not locate all the resources. Thanks to all the lovely people of the internet for free education.
